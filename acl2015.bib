abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Over the past few years, different approaches have been proposed to deal with automated skin cancer detection. Nonetheless, most of them are based only on dermoscopic images and do not take into account the patient clinical information, an important clue towards clinical diagnosis. In this work, we present an approach to fill this gap. First, we introduce a new dataset composed of clinical images, collected using smartphones, and clinical data related to the patient. Next, we propose a straightforward method that includes an aggregation mechanism in well-known deep learning models to combine features from images and clinical data. Last, we carry out experiments to compare the models’ performance with and without using this mechanism. The results present an improvement of approximately 7% in balanced accuracy when the aggregation method is applied. Overall, the impact of clinical data on models’ performance is significant and shows the importance of including these features on automated skin cancer detection.}
